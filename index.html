<p class="indent">As many slaves were gaining freedom, the army allowed them to be a resource. The army hired many of them to work in positions of non-military roles like laundry, wagon drivers, blacksmiths, & cooks, but because of Racial prejudice, they were not allowed to carry weapons or to actually fight in battle. There was also the belief that black men lacked the courage or ability to fight well. Those that did fight were discriminated against in the pay they received compared to the white man.   This was an early issue, and it caused many to believe that Black man to be inferior. It carried on for many years, and they struggled to get fair pay, equal education, and fair treatment in business. Many places in the south, today especially, still discriminate against people of color.  </p>
<p class="indent">President Lincoln warned the south that the north would not participate in prisoner Exchange unless all prisoners, regardless of race or treated as regular prisoners of war. This was a more positive side that someone realized and cared that the blacks were being treated differently and unfairly. This was a bit of a turning point, too, if you will. It was a time that others realized that skin color wasn't always making you different. One of the long-term effects of this could be the Geneva Convention of 1949, with how prisoners of war are to be treated. This would include all people of color too.    
</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="indent">The Confederate Army did not treat captured African American soldiers under the normal prisoner-of-war terms. They were treated poorly. It's estimated over 300 African-American Union soldiers were killed after they surrendered, and many more were badly beaten. This had an effect on how prisoners of war were treated, and people of color were discriminated against. Both of these things still occur today. Blacks are often treated differently by police, like George Floyd, who was killed by a Police officer. At least half of all Blacks currently report experiencing racial discrimination in the workplace and from police. This is clearly an ongoing issue that is not making much progress.  </p>

<ul>
  <li>policies and technologies of The Civil War and describe how they had a lasting impact on United States society</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent"> During the Civil War, there were many new pieces of technology because a lot of the US funding went towards getting an advantage in the south. an effect of this is the US made many new inventions, such as submarines and the repeating rifle were invented. Before the repeating rifles, infantry soldiers typically carried muskets that should only hold one bullet. The range of the musket was around 250 yards away, but the repeating rifle should shoot up to 1,000 yards away. This is a long-term effect because it changed how the world fights wars. It gave the north an advantage over the south.  </p>

<p class="indent">The development of the telegraph in the late 1840s increased the speed of communication. Communication was key, knowing where people were fighting, making plans, and getting medical help and supplies. It was also useful for tactical updates on information. This was a turning point in technology which continues to shape America today. A long-term effect is all the technology used in the Civil War is still used to this day and continues to grow. Technologies of the typewriter,  computer, emails, and more still continue to advance. Because of the advancements in technology, wars were much more successful for those fighting, especially in the south. </p>

<P class="indent">The Emancipation Proclamation was signed on January 1, 1863, by Abraham Lincoln. During this time, the nation approached its third year of civil war. The Proclamation declared "that all persons held as slaves" within the rebellious states "are, and henceforward shall be free." This would be the cause of great change. The long-term effect of the emancipation proclamation was the 13th amendment ratified on December 1865, 2 years later.</P>
<p class="indent">The Emancipation Proclamation was only applied to the states that had seceded from the US. This did not Effect the border states, which included: Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, The District, and West Virginia. The effect of this changed the outcome of the war for the US; they now had much more manpower. The next effect longer term is it sparked hope for the rest of the slaves in the US. </p>

<p class="indent">        On March 13, 1865, in the South, the US started losing hope as they faced a larger army in the north. The south was losing and desperate, so they reluctantly said if slaves were willing to fight in the war, they would be able to earn their freedom. That next year the Army and Navy had around 200,000 black soldiers and sailors that fought for the union and freedom. Because they allowed slaves to become soldiers, it prompted a politician to ask, "If slaves will make good soldiers, our whole theory of slavery is wrong." the effect of this got even more people talking about freeing the slaves. This effect became larger and larger as time went on. It is still being seen today as more African Americans and minorities are continuing to fight for equality.  </p>
<p class="indent">in 1955 Rosa Parks made strides by refusing to move to the back of the bus. In 1963 MLK gave his I have a dream speech.  This again caused even more african Americans to fight for there equality they deserve.  The effects are continuing today as we see beyond skin color and people for who they are.</p>
